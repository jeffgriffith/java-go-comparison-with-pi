# java-go-comparison-with-pi
Here I am doing a side-by-side comparison of Java 8 CompletableFutures
with Go channels. I am not making any claims about which is better here,
but I wanted to see how the two compare for readability. My observations
are these:

* Go channels easily replace futures where composibility is straightforward
and can be expressed as a simple pipeline. CompletableFutures on the
otherhand will allow for composition in more complex ways where the
result of one completion stage may be composed with MULTIPLE other
futures. I am a Go noob so perhaps there is a pattern with channels
that would allow such composition as well.

* The flip side of the observation above is that using a single channel
for a single result is a special case for channels and does not
remotely reflect its power. CompletableFutures are not intended to solve
this. Channels therefore possess both the power of the 'reactive extensions' model
AND the simplicity of futures in one very simple abstraction.

* I cheated considerably with helper fucntions to make the Java 8 look
comparable in simplicity to go. It's clear that having concurrency
front and center in the language design of Go makes it considerably
more readable. Note also that while I wrote the Go code to look as
similar as possible to the Java code, that made the Go implementation
slightly larger than it needed to be because the functions return
a separate channel for each result in the way that Java returns
a separate future for each result. In Go, using a fan-in pattern,
several workers can contribute to the same output channel with a
single consumer reading the channel and summing the results. This
version can be seen in calcpi2.go

Here is the equation for estimating PI. This allows us to break
the summation into arbitrary ranges and farm out the ranges to
several workers to be done concurrently. The result of all of the
workers can then be summed for a final estimation of PI.

This function executes an estimation for the given range asynchronously.

Create all the workers and aggregate the results. Again, the result
is produced asynchronously.

The main program. Note that in calculating 10 billion terms,
there is no doubt some over flow that limits the precision of the
answer (to about 10 decimal points i think) but I don't think this
matters in terms of the comparison.

Note that the main contains the synchronization point for both
implementations. The Java version blocks on the future calculation
result with a "join()" call where the Go main blocks on reading
from the output channel calling calculatePi.

This kind of speaks for itself. Maybe I will rewrite a Java version
without the helpers for a fair comparison.

Note however, there is an important subtlety in the sum function here.
On the java side, the sum call is a cpu-bound function requiring that
all terms have been produced. On the go side however, the sum is
running inside a go routine. This allows the go routine to be parked
when it reads from the channel at "sum += <- c" allowing for asynchrony
in code that LOOKS synchronous. While innocuous looking, THIS IS THE
POWER OF GO and of core.async if you are familiar with Clojure. It is
also a difference between the CompletableFuture and RxJava Observables
which can produce multiple values similar to Go/core.async.
